Now that we know what the knobs and buttons do it's time to use them to make music!

First we'll record a sequence of our sounds. Then we'll learn and record motion sequences and finally we'll look into active step mode and save our piece.

Before we go into recording, make sure that **M1** or rather **Motion Sequence On/Off** is off. Use **Func** and **M1** for that. We'll learn about why later.

# Recording

This is all about what creating something that you like and putting a small piece together. Feel free to use any or all of the functionality that we learned about so far! There is no real, true way oof doing that but if you have no idea at all you can follow my approach.

First clear the current memory slot with **Func** and **Clear All** to start from scratch.

I like to start with lower tones to make some kind of rhythm. Turn **Octave** to 32' and create a sound that works for you.

Press **Play** with the **Metronome** activated and try to play some notes that fit in with the tact.

You will notice the blinking red LED that indicates our position in the cycle. You can use this to orientate yourself as the cycle will loop forever and repeat the recorded sequence.

Found a good sequence? Then press **Record** to record the sequence. Press **Record** again to stop.

If you're not happy use **Func** and **Clear All** to start again.

Next I want to put something on top of it. Change the **Octave** to 8' or 4' and change the sound a little. When you're ready you can hit record and record the new sequence on top of the other one.

Repeat this until you're satisfied with what you have. This can take quite a bit off time, don't get too lost in it for now.

Don't forget to turn the **Metronome** off at some point to hear your standalone piece.

# Motion Sequence

![](/step14.jpg)

One important thing to know is that when we record something, we don't actually record the position of the knobs that are used to make the sound!

Even when you play back one of the pre-recorded sequences, you can still turn the knobs and influence the sound!

What we can record though is the movement of the knobs and this setting is called **Motion Sequence**.

Before I told you to turn it off, now turn **Motion Sequence On**.

When you **record** with **Motion sequence** activated and turn a knob, this knob will start blinking as an indicator that this movement has been recorded. You don't need to play a note, turning any knob will do.

You can clear the motion sequence with **Func** and **Motion Sequence Clear**.

Recording a motion sequence can bring some more dynamic into your piece and since you can clear it separately you can experiment with it a lot.

Sometimes it's what you want, sometimes it's not. It can get tricky though, for example then you record and then quickly want to change the LFO rate before playing a different note and then this movememnt is accidentally recorded as well.

In the beginning I think it's most effective to record your sounds without motion sequence and then consiously record a motion sequence on top of it.

Take a minute or two to experiment with recording a **Motion sequence**.

# Active Step

**Active Step** Mode lets you control the sequencer directly. That means we can decide for each step in our sequence **whether or not it should be played**. The default is that every step is played, all LEDs are on, like we had it until now.

Press **Func** and **Play** together to activate **Active Step** Mode. You should see the Func and Play blinking and all LEDs light up. Try touching a key now, the LED turns off and this specific step in the sequence is now deactivated.

Press **Play** while still in Active Step Mode (the blinking pattern changes) to hear the changes in the sequence live.

Deactivate all steps except one. Add a few more. Change them again. Get a feel for which parts of your sequence sound good isolated or minimally put together.

Press **Func** again to leave Active Step Mode. You can always enter and change this again.

You can use Active Step Mode to arrange or perform your sequence and bring a more exciting live element to it!

Experiment and figure out what you like!

# Saving to memory

Once you have your piece together, press **Func** and **Memory** and a memory slot and save it. Play it to someone!

Remember that even when playing from memory you can still manipulate the sound and make it more performative with what you learned in Motion Sequence and Active Step!

# That's it!

Congrats, you have the basics of the volca keys down!

But what's next? That depends on you!

There are a couple of things we didn't cover, since they require bit more experience, but feel free to research them.

Or you can look into how to combine multiple Volcas together via the MIDI or Sync jacks.

Or try to get your recodings into a DAW like Ableton for example.

This is only the beginning!
