The Korg Volca Keys is an **analog synthesiser**, a musical instrument that creates sound through manipulating an electrical circuit. How cool is that!

If you're completely new to synths, the knobs and buttons and how it all works together **can be quite confusing and overwhelming**. But don't worry: This tutorial is meant to easy you into the world of analog synths!

The Volca Keys is a great synth to **learn the basics**, because it has everything an analog synth needs in a nice, simple and compact interface. From here on, other synths (analog and digital) will make a lot more sense to you!

Fist we'll go over the **interface** of the Volca and explain what everything is and does. Then we'll do into **workflows** or how to use our newfound knowledge to make music.

[Start with the interface](/interface) or [go straight to workflows](/workflow)

(Of course you can also just try and turn the knobs and see what's happening, but it's definitely more straight forward if you have at least a little bit of an idea what you are doing.)
